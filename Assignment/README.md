From all the sites that used webGL that I checked out in Chrome Experiments. Such as the chunky games that were not the greatest do to how chunky and difficult they felt to play or 
the generated terrains that also used webGL that also looked stunnning. I found the kaleidoscope to be the most interesting one as every time I load the site I was looking at a new 
array of images and colors. I never got to use a kaleidoscope when I was younger so this was a really fun expereince. Furthermore you could also interact with the page using 
your mouse to change the pattern you saw onthe screen, which made interacting with the kaleidoscope more interesting.
